Introduction
------------

JSKK is a classing engine which brings object-oriented programming to the popular JavaScript language.
JSKK allows you to create classes and extend those classes, attach interfaces, mix-in traits and a
whole lot more. JSKK is light weight and easy to implement, has built in require.js support and
is compatible with node.js.

Key Features
------------

* True Object Oriented JavaScript. Give structure and meaning to your code.
* Full **Inheritance** model, allowing proper Aspect Oriented Programming.
* Model your classes around **Interfaces**.
* Class & Method **Abstraction**.
* Class **Finalisation**.
* Reusable code with **Traits**.
* Define **Required** classes and have them loaded dynamically before the class is executed.
* React to change with JSKK's variable condition watching engine.
* Built-In [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) compatibility.
